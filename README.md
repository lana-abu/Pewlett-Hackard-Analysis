# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

### The purpose of this analysis is to analyze multiple sets of data using SQL. From employment data I identify all employees eligible for retirment and group them by title. I also use the data to determine which employees in Pewlett-Hackard would be eligible for a mentorship program. 

## Results

### First point: From the retiring_titles, we can see that a majority of the people retiring are senior engineers and senior staff engineers.

## Summary

### Currently, there are over 90,000 employees eligible for retirement across 7 different categories. Only 1449 are eligible for the mentorship eligibility program to train the next group fulfilling those roles. There are not enough employees eligible to mentor every student. It's a possibility if we extend the timeframe of who is eligible for retirement we'll get an increased number of people who are eligible for retirement.
